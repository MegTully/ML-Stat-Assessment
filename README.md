# Machine Learning and Statistics
by Megan Tully

This repository contains 3 notebooks with exercises for 3 topics, Statistics,models and parameters. It also contains a project notebook called Machine Learning project and lastly this README file with some information on the repository.

This repository was created for my assessment in Machine Learning and Statistics. 
## How to run these jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
1. Download the main jupyter notebook files from this repository and any csv data to your local machine.
2. Open up your command line, I used CMDer which can be found [here](https://cmder.app/).
3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the above files.
4. Type "jupyter notebook" into the terminal and it should open up jupyter notebook in your browser with these files in it.

<b>Note</b>: You need to have jupyter notebook installed on your machine. I have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) downloaded which contains jupyter notebook. You also need a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your local machine.

You can also use [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) code to run this file by opening the folder containing the downloaded files inside the application.

### Required Packages (linked to user guides):
1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide) 
2. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html)
3. [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/)
4. [tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)

## Exercises
The notebooks containing the exercises show tasks completed throughout the course that are based on the concepts we had to explore and understand about the topics we covered.


## Project Summary
The notebook that contains the project is a recreation of the documentation on the Keras website that shows timeseries anomaly detection using an Autoencoder. This documentation shows how to use tensorflow and keras in python to create a model that can detect anomalies in data. Machine learning is used to train and test a model using data found online for streaming applications. The aim of the project was to re write the documentation an produce a more user friendly version that explains in more details the steps to go through. In the end one of my classmates should be able to read, understand and be able to reproduce the same results.
